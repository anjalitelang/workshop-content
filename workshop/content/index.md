The environment I am using is one of a set of applications useful in hosting training workshops. These can be supervised workshops run in a classroom like environment, or can be self paced workshops provided via an online interactive learning portal.

In this workshop you will learn how to create and structure the content for a workshop. You will also learn about some of the ways that the workshop can be deployed.

This home page for the workshop is where you would provide the description of your own workshop.
